# The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

# Given a number n in the Collatz sequence,
# if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n/2
# if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1

# Applying the rule above with the starting number 13, we generate the following sequence:

# 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and 
# finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet 
# (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

# Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
